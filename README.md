Managing Leftover Food Supply to the Poor Using Salesforce
1. Why Use Salesforce?

Salesforce offers a flexible platform that can help:

Track food donors and their contributions.

Coordinate collection and delivery logistics.

Engage with volunteers and NGOs.

Generate reports on food saved, people fed, and environmental impact.

üõ†Ô∏è 2. Key Components in Salesforce
Component	Purpose
Accounts & Contacts	Track donors (restaurants, hotels), NGOs, volunteers
Custom Objects	Manage food donations, collection schedules, delivery logs
Cases or Opportunities	Track individual donation drives or events
Automation (Flows, Process Builder)	Notify teams of new donations, assign pickups
Reports & Dashboards	Monitor total food saved, number of meals served, donor activity
Experience Cloud (Optional)	Create a donor/NGO/volunteer portal
Mobile App	Enable field teams to update donation pickups or deliveries in real time
üîÑ 3. Sample Process Flow in Salesforce
1. Food Donation Entry

Donors fill out a web form (via Salesforce Experience Cloud or integrated site).

Food donation details (type, quantity, location, pickup time) are recorded in a Custom Object (e.g., Food_Donation__c).

2. Pickup Coordination

Automation triggers task creation or sends alerts to logistics/volunteer teams.

Schedule is added to a calendar or routed using Salesforce Maps (if available).

3. Volunteer/NGO Assignment

Volunteers can be automatically or manually assigned to pickups based on location.

Use Assignment Rules and Queues to streamline operations.

4. Delivery Tracking

Delivery status is updated through Salesforce Mobile App or Experience Cloud portal.

Photos or receipts can be uploaded for record-keeping.

5. Impact Reporting

Dashboards display:

Total food collected

Number of meals served

Top donors

Areas served

Useful for internal analysis and sharing impact with donors.

üìà 4. Example Custom Objects
Object	Fields
Food_Donation__c	Donor, Food Type, Quantity, Expiry Date, Location, Status
Pickup_Schedule__c	Date, Time, Assigned Volunteer, Pickup Status
Delivery_Log__c	NGO/Recipient, Time, Condition of Food, Feedback
Volunteer__c	Name, Contact Info, Availability, Assigned Routes
üîê 5. Security & Compliance

Restrict access based on roles (e.g., only volunteers see assigned pickups).

Use Field-Level Security and Profiles to protect sensitive data.

Ensure data encryption for donor information and legal compliance.

ü§ñ 6. Enhancements (Optional)

AI/Einstein: Predict peak donation times or areas with high demand.

SMS/WhatsApp Integration: Send alerts to volunteers.

Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP): Leverage Salesforce's toolkit for nonprofits.

Mobile Publisher: Create a branded app for volunteers or NGOs.
